3D printable Synth Head

This project will contain all you need to customise a Synth costume head, generate an STL file and print it using a 3D printer.

Also within this will be code so that you can flash to an ESP32 for visor lights as well as a voice amplifier/changer, a touch capacitive sensor in the snoot (for booping).

The Syhnth species a was created by Vader-San. Visit https://synthspecies.com/ for information.
