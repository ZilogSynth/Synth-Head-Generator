# 3D printable Synth Head

This project will contain all you need to customise a Synth costume head, generate an STL file and print it using a 3D printer.

You can just simply use the STL files already created if you wish!

The Synth species a was created by Vader-San. Visit https://synthspecies.com/ for information.

3. Install the BOSL v2 library from https://github.com/BelfrySCAD/BOSL2
4. Open "Head.scad" in OpenSCAD
